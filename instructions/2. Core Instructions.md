# Core Instructions: Creating Copilot Instructions

This guide will walk you through creating and using GitHub Copilot Instructions in your repository. Copilot Instructions are a powerful way to customize how GitHub Copilot assists with your codebase by providing specific guidelines and preferences.

## What are Copilot Instructions?

Copilot Instructions are markdown files that contain guidelines, coding standards, and preferences that GitHub Copilot uses when generating code suggestions for your project. They help ensure consistent code quality and adherence to your project's specific requirements.

## Step 1: Understanding the Structure

Copilot Instructions files typically have:
- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata specifying description and file patterns
- **Structured sections**: Organized guidelines for different aspects of development
- **Clear, actionable rules**: Specific instructions Copilot can follow

## Step 2: Create Your C# Instructions File

Let's create a Copilot Instructions file based on the excellent C# guidelines from the [awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/csharp.instructions.md).

### 2.1 Create the Instructions Directory and File

First, create the `.github/instructions` directory in your repository root to store your instructions:

```bash
mkdir .github
mkdir .github/instructions
```

Then navigate to this directory to create your instructions file:

```bash
cd .github/instructions
```

### 2.2 Create the C# Instructions File

Create a new file at `.github/instructions/csharp.instructions.md`:

**Using VS Code:**
1. Right-click in the `.github/instructions` folder in the Explorer panel
2. Select "New File"
3. Name it `csharp.instructions.md`

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
# Navigate to the .github/instructions directory
cd .github/instructions

# Create the file (Windows PowerShell)
New-Item -Name "csharp.instructions.md" -ItemType "file"

# Or create the file (Windows Command Prompt/Git Bash)
touch csharp.instructions.md
```

**Copy and paste this content into the file:**
```markdown
---
description: 'Guidelines for building C# applications'
applyTo: '**/*.cs'
---

# C# Development

## C# Instructions
- Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.

## General Instructions
- Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Document the code with file headers and XML documentation comments for public methods and classes.

## Testing Guidelines
- Include test cases for all arithmetic operations
- Test edge cases like division by zero
- Verify proper exception handling
- Use meaningful test method names that describe the scenario
```

## Step 3: Verify Your Instructions Work

After creating your instructions file:

1. **Open a new Chat Editor** (Ctrl+N or Cmd+N) to ensure Copilot loads the new instructions
2. **Test with the Calculator**: Open a C# file in your calculator project
3. **Ask Copilot**: Use Copilot Chat to ask for code suggestions
4. **Observe**: Notice how Copilot follows your specific guidelines

### Testing Examples

Try asking Copilot Chat:
- "Write a unit test for the Add method"
- "Create error handling for division by zero"
- "Add documentation to the Calculator class"

## Summary

By following this guide, you've accomplished:

1. ✅ **Learned** what Copilot Instructions are and why they're useful
2. ✅ **Created** a C# instructions file with proper structure
3. ✅ **Understood** how frontmatter and file patterns work
4. ✅ **Applied** instructions to your calculator project
5. ✅ **Tested** that your instructions work with Copilot

Your GitHub Copilot will now provide more targeted, consistent suggestions that align with your coding standards and project requirements.

## Next Steps

Continue your Copilot learning journey:

- **Experiment** with different instruction styles for various projects
- **Create** project-specific instruction files for different technologies
- **Share** instruction files with your development team
- **Explore** other instruction templates in the [awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot)
